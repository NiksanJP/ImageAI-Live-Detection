# ImageAI-Live-Detection
Simple detection technique using ImageAI. This uses darknet's YOLOv3 which is only compatible with Linux and MAC. I decided to use Opencv and open each frame and process it with Image AI image detection.

# Installation
  install Image AI
  download YOLOv3 <a href="https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/yolo.h5"> here </a>
